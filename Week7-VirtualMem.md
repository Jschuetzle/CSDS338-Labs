## Why Virtual Memory? <a name = "why-vmem"></a>
In class, Loui has talked about virtual memory and how virtual memory addresses _map_ into physical addresses. **If we end up using physical memory in the end though, what is the point of having virtual memory?**

This is just some thinking I'm putting down to be organized later...
+ Virtual memory is just an abstraction--an illusion--that allows processes believe that they own all the memory on the system
+ It's about isolating processes from each other's memory (be more specific)
